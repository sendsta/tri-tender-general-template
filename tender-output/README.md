# Tender Output

**This folder is where your tender response documents will be created.**

---

## ⚠️ Important: No Pre-Defined Structure

This folder is **intentionally empty** because:

1. **There are NO template files** to edit
2. **Document structure is determined by YOUR tender**
3. **Every tender response is unique**

The AI will create documents here based on what YOUR specific tender requires—not based on any standard template.

## How Documents Get Created

### Step 1: Structure Discovery
The AI analyses your tender document and identifies:
- Required documents
- Mandatory sections
- Prescribed formats
- Naming conventions

### Step 2: Structure Approval
The AI presents the proposed structure:
```
Example (will vary per tender):

Your tender requires:
├── Technical_Proposal.html
│   ├── Section 1: Company Background
│   ├── Section 2: Understanding of Requirements
│   ├── Section 3: Proposed Methodology
│   └── Section 4: Project Team
├── Financial_Proposal.html
│   ├── Pricing Schedule
│   └── Payment Terms
└── Compliance_Documents.html
    ├── Completed Declaration Form
    └── Certificate Index
```

**You approve this structure before creation begins.**

### Step 3: Document Creation
Documents are created one by one, with your review after each.

---

## Document Naming

Documents are named according to:

1. **Tender-specified names** (if the tender prescribes specific names)
2. **Tender reference + logical names** (if not specified)

Examples:
- `TenderRef_Part_A_Technical.html`
- `RFP2024_001_Financial_Proposal.html`
- `Form_SBD4_Declaration.html`
